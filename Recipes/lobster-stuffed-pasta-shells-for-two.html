        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>reserved lobster shells</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 splash water</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><em>Shells</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 large pasta shells</li>
            <li>1/3 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon olive oil (optional)</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
            <li>1 pinch chopped fresh parsley (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h2><em>Directions</em></h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>This step is optional, but greatly improves the flavor and look of the final dish: Wilt spinach in a dry pan over medium-high heat, transfer into a strainer. Let cool, then squeeze out excess water, and chop with a knife. Refrigerate until needed.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cut lengthwise with scissors along the center of each lobster shell on both top and bottom, and remove meat. Set shells aside for sauce. Open up lobster tail meat down the center, slicing open with a knife if necessary, and devein if needed. Rinse briefly under cold water to remove any grit.</p></li>  
        <li><p>Chop meat with a knife into small pieces, about 1/4-inch in size. Transfer into a mixing bowl; add chopped spinach, ricotta, mozzarella, lemon zest, garlic, salt, cayenne, and smoked paprika. Mix thoroughly; refrigerate until needed.</p></li>  
        <li><p>Cut reserved lobster shells with scissors into 1-inch pieces. Melt butter over medium-high heat in a saucepan, and add lobster shells. Cook, stirring, until lobster shells turn a deep red-orange color and smell like cooked lobster, 1 to 2 minutes.</p></li>  
        <li><p>Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds more. Pour in cream; rinse measuring cup with a small splash of water and add to the saucepan. Season with salt and cayenne. Bring to a boil, adjust temperature to prevent boiling over, and cook until cream reduces and thickens slightly, enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 4 minutes.</p></li>  
        <li><p>Pour lobster cream through a fine mesh strainer set over a bowl, allowing all liquid to drain through. Set cream sauce aside until needed; discard shells.</p></li>  
        <li><p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add shells and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes less than package directions. Transfer shells into a bowl of cold water to cool immediately, then drain well.</p></li>  
        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p></li>  
        <li><p>Use a spoon to generously stuff 8 cooked pasta shells with lobster filling.</p></li>  
        <li><p>Spoon about three quarters of lobster cream sauce into a (1-quart) baking dish. A cake pan or deep pie dish can also be used. Arrange stuffed shells in the dish, evenly spaced not more than about 1/2 inch apart.</p></li>  
        <li><p>Top each shell with a small amount of mozzarella. Drizzle a few teaspoons of remaining lobster cream sauce over top of each shell. Any extra sauce can be added to the baking dish if desired, or reserved to reheat and serve with cooked shells.</p></li>  
        <li><p>Grate a small amount of Parmesan over the top, and drizzle with olive oil if desired.</p></li>  
        <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and hot throughout, and golden brown on top, 25 to 30 minutes.</p></li>  
        <li><p>Let rest at least 5 minutes before serving.</p></li>          
    </ol>
