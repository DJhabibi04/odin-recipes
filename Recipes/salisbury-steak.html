                    <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
                </ul>
            <h3><em>Gravy:</em></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
                    <li>12 large white button mushrooms, sliced</li>
                    <li>1 cup diced onion</li>
                    <li>salt to taste</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li> 
                    <li>3 cups high-quality, low-sodium beef broth</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
                </ul>
        <h2><em>Steps</em></h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><P>Prepare the steaks: Mix ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, soy sauce, pepper, and cayenne together in a mixing bowl with a fork or your hands until well combined. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.</P></li>
                    <li><P>When almost ready to cook the steaks, make the gravy: Melt butter in a large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add mushrooms, onion, and salt; sauté until nicely browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and add flour; cook and stir for 3 minutes.</P></li>
                    <li><P>Stir in broth, ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce. Increase the heat to high and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until gravy thickens slightly and reduces, about 10 minutes. Taste and adjust salt as needed.</P></li>
                    <li><P>Transfer gravy to a liquid measure. Scrape the pan clean with a spatula.</P></li>
                    <li><P>Finish the steaks: Remove meat from the refrigerator and divide into four equal portions. Moisten hands and form each portion into a 1/2-inch-thick oval patty. Lightly season both sides of patties with salt.</P></li>
                    <li><P>Melt butter in the clean skillet over medium-high heat. Add patties and cook until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Pour in gravy and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium and continue to cook until gravy is piping hot and steaks are no longer pink in the center, about 5 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</P></li>
